# Breast-Cancer-Image-Classification
Predicting benign or malignant breast tissue via image classification

This was my capstone for Spring 2023 at SCSU. This was a comparison of several model's performance vs classifying breast cancer tissue images. EfficientNet-b0 had the best performance at 95% accuracy, F1-Score of 0.83 and a MCC of 0.80.
